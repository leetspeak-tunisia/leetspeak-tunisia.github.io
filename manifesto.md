This is our manifesto; a public declaration of the intentions, motives, and views of the Leetspeak Tunisian Collective.

# Call of duty

This is a call for Hackers, for those who love to break things to discover how they work internally, for those who believe that knowledge is the real power, for those who see the math behind the trees, for those who make stupid things learn and try to replicate the human thinking behavior, for those who are fed up that Tunisia is just a Tech consumer, for those who are trying to protect themselves and people around them for mass surveillance, for people who believe in a better economic system through distributed trust mechanisms, for those who are building and learning to build Systems and machines. 

This is a call for Tunisian hackers worldwide to unite and to produce an intermediate to advanced tech resources in order to help newcomers advance and believe in the possibilities. 

*Let's write articles and build a strong community around them.*

# Ethics

We consider that the ethic and the code of conduct of all activities in a relationship with leetspeak should follow Levy's hacker ethics stated in his book "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (ISBN 0-440-13405-6, 1984) :

- Access to computers - and anything which might teach you something about the way the world really works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
- All information should be free.
- Mistrust authority - promote decentralization.
- Hackers should be judged by their acting, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
- You can create art and beauty on a computer.
- Computers can change your life for the better.
- Don't litter other people's data.
- Make public data available, protect private data.

# Language

We chose English because it is the official language of 53 countries. This will enforce the worldwide nature of our initiative. We also accept a reasonable amount of hacker slang as defined in [The Jargon File][jargon-file].
