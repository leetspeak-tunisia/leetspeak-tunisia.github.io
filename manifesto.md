title: Leetspeak Manifesto
permalink: /manifesto/
---
Leetspeak is a learning-oriented collective that is open to everyone, our
 primary focus is to encourage learning, blogging in order to deepen knowledge
 on various computer science areas.

This is our manifesto; a public declaration of the intentions, motives  and
 views of the Leetspeak Collective.

# Call of duty

This is a call for Hackers, for those who love to break things to discover
 how they work internally, for those who believe that knowledge is the real
 power, for those who see the math behind the trees, for those who make stupid 
 things learn and try to replicate the human thinking behavior, for those who 
 are fed up to be tech consumer, for those who are trying to protect 
 themselves and people around them for mass surveillance, for people who 
 believe in a better economic system through distributed trust mechanisms, 
 for those who are building and learning to build Systems and machines. 

This is a call for hackers of the world to unite and to produce an intermediate
 to advanced tech resources in order to help newcomers advance and believe 
 in the possibilities. 

*Let's write articles and build a strong community around them.*

# Ethics

We consider that the ethic and the code of conduct of all activities in a 
relationship with leetspeak should follow Levy's hacker ethics stated 
in his book "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution 
(ISBN 0-440-13405-6, 1984) :

- Access to computers - and anything which might teach you something about the way the world really works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
- All information should be free.
- Mistrust authority - promote decentralization.
- Hackers should be judged by their acting, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race or position.
- You can create art and beauty on a computer.
- Computers can change your life for the better.
- Don't litter other people's data.
- Make public data available, protect private data.

# Topics

Any other topic suggestion should be communicated through a github Issue.

# Language

We chose English because it is the official language of 53 countries. This 
 will enforce the worldwide nature of our initiative. We also accept 
 a reasonable amount of hacker slang as defined in [The Jargon File][jargon-file].
